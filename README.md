# Project-3-OC-Game

The purpose of this project is to learn the fundamentals of the Swift language.

During this experience, I became familiar with the basics of Swift Types, as classes, enumerations, protocols and extensions.

The goal of this war game is to create 2 teams with 3 characters each, and fight at each round, in a turn-based strategy game. Once a team gets all its characters dead, it loses and the other team wins.

If you get lucky (or not), on each turn you can have the possibility to win a bonus, that could change the course of the game.

To do this activity, I mainly got information from [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/1823851-apprenez-a-programmer-en-swift/1823861-presentation-de-swift), [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5994-programming-in-swift), [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [docs.swift](https://swift.org/). I also got advice from my OpenClassrooms mentor and from another experienced iOS developer.
